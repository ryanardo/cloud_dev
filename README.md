## Google Cloud Platform Repos

### [NodeJS Speech to Text API](https://github.com/ryanglenferris/nodejs-speech.git)

**My objective was to learn how to utilize Google's Speech to Text API by following along with the Google Cloud Tutorial.**

**I was able to complete their tutorial , but I have not yet managed to refactor it for my own purposes. I still need to learn how the audio files are referenced/pointed to; and how to tell the API to keep listening to a file if it is longer than 60 seconds.**

### [Google Cloud Java Examples](https://github.com/ryanglenferris/google-cloud-java.git)

**I am particularly interested in Googles Speech to Text API, and the only language that service is documented in currently is NodeJS, so I have not had an opportunity to attempt Java examples yet. I plan on mastering the Speech to Text service, then recreating that in Java (my preferred language).**
