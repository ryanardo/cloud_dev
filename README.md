## Google Cloud Platform Repos

### [NodeJS Speech to Text API](https://github.com/ryanglenferris/nodejs-speech.git)

**My objective was to learn how to utilize Google's Speech to Text API by following along with the [Google Cloud Tutorial](https://github.com/googleapis/nodejs-speech/tree/master/samples#google-cloud-speech-api-nodejs-samples).**

**I was able to complete their tutorial , but I have not yet managed to refactor it for my own purposes. I still need to learn how the audio files are referenced/pointed to; and how to tell the API to keep listening to a file if it is longer than 60 seconds.**

### [Google Cloud Java Examples](https://github.com/ryanglenferris/google-cloud-java.git)

**I spent more time with the NodeJS tutorials that Google offers. Although I didn't get a chance to attempt I still plan on utilizing it in the future.**
